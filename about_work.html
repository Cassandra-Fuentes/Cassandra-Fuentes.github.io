        <h3>Elevator Speech</h3>
    <p>I work as an instructional designer for Discover Financial Services.
      I started working at Discover in 2010. My plan was to work at Discover for six months, or until I finished my Social Work degree and found a new job. I started training new hire employees in 2013, and then moved into an instructional design role in 2015. In 2016, I worked on a team to build 130 Onboarding Training Plans to meet the deadline for a critical audit. We successfully created over 2,000 activities within a few months, and saved the company a substantial amount of money. Click the button below to learn more about what I do now.</p>

          <h3>Onboarding Training Plans</h3>
          <p> Onboard Training Plans or OTPs, were the first learning projects that I worked on. These were created because few people were being trained in some departments and we needed to prove that training was actually taking place. In situations where few people are going through training, it is ineffective to assign one facilitator to train an employee when we can leverage subject matter experts and documentation within the department.</p>
        <p>To meet the needs of the department, we created simple documents that directed the learner to review documentation and then sit with a SME to watch the process take place. Once the learner reviewed all of the documents and observed each task within the program, the learner would take an assessment to confirm adequate proficiency to use the procedures and work through the tasks within the job.</p>

          <h3>Instructor Led Training</h3>
          <p>When I explain Instructor Led Training, I tell people that I create training packets that faciliators pass out during training classes. It's a simple explanation and people grasp on to it pretty easily because almost everyone has received a document or packet for learning in one of the learning environments they've encountered in their life. One of the things that I love about ILT work is getting to work in Adobe FrameMaker. It was really difficult for me to pick up in the beginning, but after a while I realized that it's kind of like authoring something in HTML.</p>
                             <p>My experience with ILT development forced me to hone my skills in chunking and sequencing, utilizing techniques like activating prior knowledge, and developing more robust activities to promote knowledge transfer. Developing ILTs also gave me experience in InDesign and Captivate, which has helped me with projects outside of work.</p>

          <h3>Classroom Evolution</h3>
          <p>Classroom Evolution or CEVO has been one of my favorite experiences so far. I would say that CEVO is the closest I've been to developing eLearning at work. We're using a program called Flow that allows us to develop webpages using a more user-friendly method than simply coding. Don't get me wrong, coding is pretty fun, but this application is <i>slick</i>! In terms of methodology, we're using much of the same methods as we do in ILT, however it's SO much more interactive and we're designing with the intent that the learner gets to choose their path to completion. </p>
