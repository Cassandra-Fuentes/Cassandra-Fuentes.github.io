    <p>I saw myself in many different careers as a kid. First an ice skater, then a musician, an interior designer, and then a social worker. Two days after graduating high school, I started my associate's degree at Salt Lake Community College. I finished in 2009 and began the University of Utah's Bachelor of Social Work program in 2010. I graduated in 2012, just before giving birth to my first son, Dante. I found mysef missing the structure that comes with classes. The stress of Finals Week. Living my life a semester at a time. I decided to reutrn to capture all of my passions, particularly the passion that involves helping others learn new skills through effective learning materials. </p>

    <p>I started scrapbooking photos to tell a story when I was in fourth grade. In ninth grade, I worked on the yearbook committee and fell in love with creating layouts.  In high school, I started playing with the settings on photo editors to manipulate the way my photos looked. After having children, I decided to invest in a DSLR camera and actually learn how to use it. I'm not perfect, but I proudly declare that I love the images of my family that I have taken way more than anything PhotoFly or CameraShy has captured.</p>

     <p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. The first song I remember paying attention to was Beastie Boys'<i>Fight for Your Right</i>. From there, I was exposed to an array of New Wave, Rock, Hip Hop, Country, and Pop tunes. When I was six, I begged my grandma to buy me a recorder and I learned how to play songs from the Lion King.  Sang to the radio, forced my family and friends to watch me "perform". And then scored my first lead role as Annie in the musical <i>Annie Jr.</i> I participated in a couple of other musicals in junior high before I started back in to exploring music beyond musical theatre. In high school, I met a woman who taught vocal technique. She did shows in New York City and performed for the Utah Opera. As a kid, my dad told me "you can't really sing until you can sing opera." Which motivated me to study under this woman. I got pretty good. I performed in a few festivals and competitions, and earned a tuition waiver for singing. I had to pursue a "real career", so I stopped studying music. Now, I sing recreationally and I'm the designated funeral singer for my family. Which is quite an honor.  </p>
    <p> At the age of 8, I began to play piano. I took lessons for a couple of years. During my junior high years, I didn't practice aggressively. Just enough to retain what I learned. I started lessons again as a young adult. An attempt to relieve stress and fill my time. It was a really positive experience and I grew as a pianist and performer. My grandmother passed down a player piano that was in our family in 2011. It has been in my house since. I have struggled to find someone who will replace the tubing and fix a hammer on a key that is broken. Because of the nature of the piano, I recently chose to upgrade to a digital piano that fits in a small space in my home office. It has been liberating, relaxing, and a little bit of a challenge to pick up new music and play.</p>
