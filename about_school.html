  <h3>Foundations of Instructional Design</h3>
  <p>This class taught me the Instructional Design process from start to finish. We were taught the importance of planning, then given the task to apply our knowledge of the concepts learned to an actual design problem. My team chose a problem I was encoutering at work. We had the opportunity to interview, complete a task analysis, create goals and objectives from the course. Click the links to see the paper and presentation associated with this project. </p>

  <h3>Foundations of Learning</h3>
  <p>Foundations of Learning helped me compare and contrast different learning theories. By the end of the class, we were expected to create our own learning theory and test it. I was surprised to see how some of the learning theories overlapped eachother, and how the accuracy or application of tthe theories seem to change by cirucmstance. I think the most fun part of this class was creating my own learning theory and then testing it. Review my papers for this project below. </p>  <br><br>

  <h3>Human Computer Interaction</h3>
  <p>HCI was all about determining a need, creating a low-fidelity product, getting user feedback and then using that feedback to create a high-fidelity product. I really enjoyed this class and felt like the class offered the most growth. I think this is primarily because user testing and feedback is not something we do a lot in my role as a designer at work. Much of the feedback we receive is from our learners by way of an L1 survey and we rely on the learner's performance metrics to tell us how effective the course was at teaching the learner. After this class, I brought this up to my team and suggested that we implement a process that allows for more testing and feedback because it is something I'm excited about. </p>

  <h3>Multimedia Learning</h3>
  <p>I LOVED multimedia learning class! I came into the class already familiar with Adobe Photoshop, but it was a blast to learn Adobe Premiere, Illustrator and basic web development skills. You're on my web page, so you can definitely see the fruits of that class. But I also feel like I learned a lot in terms of using Adobe programs. Check out my favorite project below. </p> <br> <br>

  <h3>Integration of Educational Technology</h3>
  <p>This class has been helpful for me as I've been working the CEVO process at work. One of the biggest things this class helped me with was developing new ideas for activities that employ different types of technology. Additionally, in this class we were given the opportunity to reflect on existing tools, such as websites, applications, and other technological devices to determine their effectiveness and safety for a learner. I really appreciated these assignments because it introduced me to a decision making matrix that I think I may be able to use on a local committee that I serve on. Finally, I was given the opportunity to identify IEST standards that I'm already practicing and some that I should develop. Over the long run, having an awareness of and developing skills to operate on these standards will help me be a better educator, leader and designer.</p>

  <h3>Introduction to Web-Based Tools</h3>
  <p>This class was a nice continuation of the Multimedia Learning class. We focused on Java Script, JQuery, and Captivate. Final Project coming soon!</p>
