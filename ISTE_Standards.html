          <h3>ISTE Standards for Educators – 1</h3>
          <p> <i>Educators continually improve their practice by learning from and with others and exploring proven and promising practices that leverage technology to improve student learning.</i></p>
            <p><b>Evidence: </b> As a master’s student I have had the opportunity to attend classes that promote learning and using technology. I have developed a better understanding of learning theories, honed skills in low and high-fidelity creation and testing web development, multimedia tools. <br>In addition to interacting with my instructors and cohort, I have leveraged social media to make contacts with other professionals in the industry. I have enjoyed the insight and knowledge gained from these people. </p>
            <b>Examples:</b><br> 
<a href="about_school.html"> Introduction to Learning Theories</a> <br>
<a href="about_school.html">Multimedia Learning</a><br>
<a href="about_school.html">Human Computer Interaction</a><br>
          

    
<br><p><b>Reflection:</b> Having these skills allows me to be a better designer. Before developing this standard, I failed to recognize the process and the benefits to developing my own content first using a low-fi prototype and then moving into a high-fi prototype. This has particularly helped me in my work environment and has saved me a bit of time and grief as I’ve developed learning activities and programs. </p>
<br>   <p> <b>Goal:</b> My goal is continue to develop and refine my skills. I’d like to find ways to leverage my ID network by asking for feedback on existing projects and accepting opportunities to work on projects outside of work and school to develop my portfolio.

          <h3>ISTE Standards for Educators – 4</h3>
          <p> <i>Educators design authentic, learner-driven activities and environments that recognize and accommodate learner variability. </i></p>
            <p><b>Evidence:</b>  <a href="about_school.html">Human Computer Interaction</a>


          

    
<br><p><b>Reflection:</b> My team members and I created this application during our HCI class in the Spring. The team did a lot of research with ESL students to try to understand how learners feel that they would best learn a new language. Many students claimed that they learned best from watching Netflix shows, in addition to the more traditional method of attending regular classes. One thing that came from this research that we attempted to solve for was the way that students still felt uncomfortable in conversation, even though they were familiar with the vocabulary. We hoped to solve for this by not just teaching the vocabulary, but also helping the learner use the vocabulary correctly in conversation.  </p>
<p> <b>Goal:</b> One of the biggest challenges at work right now is making learner-centered content that accommodates various types of learners. One of the biggest limitations that we face as an organization at this time is developing content that is relatively easy to develop and maintain. I want to continue to learn and create ways to accommodate different learning needs while balancing the organization’s need to create content that is easy to maintain.

          <h3>ISTE Standards for Coaches – 4.B</h3>
          <p> <i>Design, develop, and implement technology-rich professional learning programs that model principles of adult learning and promote digital age best practices in teaching, learning, and assessment.</i></p>
            <p><b>Evidence: </b> At work I have the opportunity to design and develop an array of learning programs. From instructor led to self-paced learning. I use a variety of technological tools from presentations to interactive web pages to teach and assess learning. </p>
            <b>Examples:</b><br> 
<a href="about_work.html"> About Work</a> <br>
          

    
<br><p><b>Reflection:</b> This is the standard I feel most comfortable with. I have developed self-paced learning and assessments for almost four years. One of the things that I have noticed in this time is that the skill sets that we’re teaching learners have changed. For example, rather than focusing on a very specific task, such as understanding one concept or call type, we are focusing on helping the learner develop specific skills such as using procedures to find information or understanding a system. I love finding new ways to introduce content in an engaging manner. It is important to me that I am developing interactive scenarios to assist in knowledge transfer. Especially because some content can be challenging to get through. I have a lot of confidence in my ability to design and develop assessments that confirm knowledge specific to course goals and objectives. I happen to be really passionate about assessments. </p>
<br>   <p> <b>Goal:</b> I want to share my knowledge and passion about assessments and continue to develop my skills in developing exciting content for learners.

          <h3>ISTE Standards for Students – 4</h3>
          <p> <i>Students use a variety of technologies within a design process to identify and solve problems by creating new, useful or imaginative solutions. </i></p>
            <p><b>Evidence: </b> <a href="about_school.html">Introduction to Instructional Design</a>
            

    
<br><p><b>Reflection:</b> Completing the final project was a really insightful experience. At the company that I work for, our design processes are broken up by steps and employees only work certain roles in the process, opposed to what happens in other areas of the industry where the designer is doing the entire process from start to finish. It was in this class that I learned about each role and how to complete a project from start to finish. </p>
<br>   <p> <b>Goal:</b> I want to find and participate in more opportunities where I can complete a project from start to finish.</p>

          <h3>ISTE Standards for Students 1</h3>
          <p> <i>Students articulate and set personal learning goals, develop strategies leveraging technology to achieve them and reflect on the learning process itself to improve learning outcomes. </i></p>
            <p><b>Evidence: </b> <br>
    
<a href="index.html"> Web-Based Portfolio</a> <br>
<a href="about_school.html">Integration of Educational Technology</a><br>
<a href="about_work.html">CEVO</a><br>
          

    
<br><p><b>Reflection:</b> My goals for this program were to learn how to use technology to effectively teach a learner and become more familiar with certain systems that my organization is using. I feel like I’ve been able to use technology to successfully create a web page, create content for the web page using technology I didn’t know how to use. I’ve also spent time reflecting on how activities and classes have helped me develop. Specifically, by way of feedback in the classroom. Interestingly, identifying ISTE standards have been helpful in identifying strengths and opportunities for growth as a learner, educator, coach and leader. </p>
<br>   <p> <b>Goal:</b> As mentioned, doing the ISTE standards made me realize I have a lot of room for growth. My hope is to identify two or three more standards that will have the most impact on the work I will do as a designer and develop those by the end of the year.
