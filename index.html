            <h3>Back to School</h3>
    <p>I saw myself in many different careers as a kid. First an ice skater, then a musician, an interior designer, and then a social worker. Two days after graduating high school, I started my associate's degree at Salt Lake Community College. I finished in 2009 and began the University of Utah's Bachelor of Social Work program in 2010. I graduated in 2012, just before giving birth to my first son, Dante. I found mysef missing the structure that comes with classes. The stress of Finals Week. Living my life a semester at a time. I decided to reutrn to capture all of my passions, particularly the passion that involves helping others learn new skills through effective learning materials. </p>

            <h3>Design and I</h3>
    <p>I started scrapbooking photos to tell a story when I was in fourth grade. In ninth grade, I worked on the yearbook committee and fell in love with creating layouts.  In high school, I started playing with the settings on photo editors to manipulate the way my photos looked. After having children, I decided to invest in a DSLR camera and actually learn how to use it. I'm not perfect, but I proudly declare that I love the images of my family that I have taken way more than anything PhotoFly or CameraShy has captured.</p>

            <h3>Elevator Speech</h3>
    <p>I work as an instructional designer for Discover Financial Services.
      I started working at Discover in 2010. My plan was to work at Discover for six months, or until I finished my Social Work degree and found a new job. I started training new hire employees in 2013, and then moved into an instructional design role in 2015. In 2016, I worked on a team to build 130 Onboarding Training Plans to meet the deadline for a critical audit. We successfully created over 2,000 activities within a few months, and saved the company a substantial amount of money. Click the button below to learn more about what I do now.</p>
